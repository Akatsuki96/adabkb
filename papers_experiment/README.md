# Experiments in papers
In this directory you'll find every script used to perform the experiments showed in papers. 

To reproduce the results, you need to install adabkb and dependeces required. You can install deps by using the requirement.txt file contained in experiment directory.

To repeat the hyperparameter tuning experiment you have to install Falkon[https://github.com/FalkonML/falkon] and download the datasets:

- HTRU: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2
- CASP: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure
- Magic04: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope
